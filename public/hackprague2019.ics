DESCRIPTION:Together\, we were able to “touch the future” last year and 
 now that “the future is already here\, it’s up to us to distribute it eq
 ually”.\n\nNowadays\, there’s plenty of data available about anything yo
 u might have in mind\, be it traffic\, Earth’s surface or your own neigh
 bourhood. Even if there’s little data available in a particular area\, t
 he latest technologies enable us to collect and process information with
  nearly real time speed. Although\, it is now easier than ever to collec
 t data\, it has become increasingly challenging to analyze and use the d
 ata meaningfully.\n\nThat's why we've decided to go with one main challe
 nge this year: "Use available data to improve the quality of life in cit
 ies”. \n\nCheck out the website at https://hackprague.com/hackathon2019/
  for more info and see you in Prague on 4-5 May\, 2019! \n\nAny question
